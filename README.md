__Description__

Classic Shit-man game.

__Game Rules__

52 card deck; 2+ players. Each player starts with 9 cards, three of them are face down and inaccessible, three are laid face up 
on top of the three face down cards and are also inaccessible. The remaining three cards are on hand and are accessible.

The player with the lowest card that isn't a Speciality Card starts by placing a card on hand. If two or more players both have the lowest card, they follow
the hierarchy of sorts. The hierarchy of sorts are, in descending order: Hearts, Spades, Diamonds and Clubs. The low card that has the highest sort starts.
The player to the left must then place a card that is equal to or higher on top of the placed deck and pull a card from the remaining deck,
and the player to the left does the same, and the next player and so forth. If the player doesn't have a card equal to or higher the top of the placed deck
the player can take a "risk", by playing the top card from the remaining deck, without seeing what it is, if the risk card is equal to or higher then 
the top of the placed deck the game proceeds as usual, if it is lower the player picks up the placed deck. Once the remaining deck is finished each player finishes their hand.
Once their hand is finished the 3 cards facing up become available and can be placed. Once the three cards facing up are finished the three cards
facing down become available. The player who finishes their cards wins.
